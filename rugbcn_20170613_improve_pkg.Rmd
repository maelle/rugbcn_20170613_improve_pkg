# Introduction

## Who am I? (1/2)

* Data manager/statistician for CHAI project at ISGlobal.

* PhD in statistics.

* R user, developper, addict.

* R-Ladies BCN co-organizer.

* Co-editor at rOpenSci onboarding (more on that later!)

## Who am I? (2/2): Mowgli's sister!

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mowgli.jpg")
```

## What does improving the package mean?

* Coding style (against errors, and for future readers&contributors)

* Tests (such good safeguards!)

* Structure (follow the rules)

* Documentation (think of the users, including you in 3 months!)

* Not mentioned today: features, performance

## Functions for improving packages!

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tweet.png")
```

## Automatic tools?

* Automatic suggestions of improvements

* Not automatic corrections... Animo!

## Today's talk

For each tool,

* Introduction

* Application to `fakepackage`. https://github.com/maelle/fakepackage

Questions any time chic@s!


# R CMD Check

## R CMD Check, what's that?

* Necessary before any CRAN submission, useful anyway

* Package structure (bye bye, left-over files), missing documentation, dependencies.

* Runs tests, checks examples and vignettes.

* ERROR/WARNING/NOTE

## R CMD Check live

## Not time for it but...

* Continuous integration is great!

# `lintr`, Static Code Analysis for R

## What is Jim Hester's `lintr`?


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/linters.png")
```

## Let's use `lintr`!

## Bonus tip, `lintr` unit test

Forces yourself and contributors to e.g. respect coding style. 

* the test

```r
if (requireNamespace("lintr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  context("lints")
  test_that("Package Style", {
    lintr::expect_lint_free()
  })
}
```

* .lintr at the root if non-default linters

```r
with_defaults(camel_case_linter = NULL, # you prefer camel case 
              snake_case_linter, # so flag snake case
              line_length_linter(120)) # you love long lines

```

# `goodpractice`, Advice on R Package Building by Gabor Csardi

## `goodpractice` presentation

* actually uses some `lintr` linters.

* tunable but I like the defaults.

* by the way one reference = Hadley Wickham's book ["R Packages"](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)

## `goodpractice` and `fakepackage`

# `devtools::spell_check()`

## `devtools::spell_check()`

* Function written by Jeroen Ooms.

* Let's try it!

* Also good to know, `devtools::release()` when submitting a package to CRAN.

# `pkgdown`, Generate static html documentation for an R package 

## `pkgdown`

* A package by Hadley Wickham.

* Currently only on Github like `goodpractice`.

* Minimal effort from existing documentation to website!

## `pkgdown` for `fakepackage`

* `pkgdown::build_website()` after correcting my name.

* Change settings of the Github repo.

* Add URL in repo and advertise it!

## `pkgdown` on `fakepackage`: customization

* Create a file at the root of the repo called `_pkgdown.yml`

* Styles, see https://bootswatch.com/

* Group functions & vignettes. Use `pkgdown::template_blabla` as starting point.

Example https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr/blob/master/_pkgdown.yml

# Conclusion

## Tools we've seen

* R CMD check

* `lintr`

* `devtools::spell_check()`

* `goodpractice::gp()`

* `pkgdown::build_site()`

## Tools we haven't seen

* Continuous integration, cf [this post of Julia Silge's](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Beginners-Guide-to-Travis/)

* Online code coverage services such as codecov.io

* Any other suggestion?

## Small tip before even creating your package

Package name check via `available`. https://github.com/ropenscilabs/available

```r
available::available("dplyr")
available::available("chicken")
```

## Have your code&docs read by humans

* Peer-review at work or among friends

* [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/), [Journal of Open Science Software](http://joss.theoj.org/about)

* [rOpenSci onboarding system!](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding) Who wants to become a reviewer?
